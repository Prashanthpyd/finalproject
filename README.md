Project Title- Agrofarm

Problem Statement/Opportunity- Today, against the backdrop of globalisation, some farm produce is cultivated thousands of miles away from where it is consumed. For instance, most of the world’s coffee is produced in Brazil and Vietnam; however, coffee users enjoy the product all over the world. The logistics and technicalities involved in making this happen are possible by virtue of technology’s integration into agriculture. High-tech storage facilities now mean farm produce can be stored for more extended periods, or if the need is for an indefinite period, by preprocessing. Aside from propagating productivity and profitability, these improved storage mechanisms cut down wastage, something that was formerly commonplace in the sector. Technology holds the key to precipitating this surge. Provided the rate of technological evolution is kept on par with agricultural innovation, one can expect even higher efficiency, effectiveness and productivity from the sector.

Project Description-This is a web based application developed for an agriculture named Agrofarm. This web based agro-farming application has been developed for the accomplishment of Future Ready Talent Internship program launched by Microsoft, Future Skills Prime, Quess, Github and EY.
